Description: Vertical jump analysis, particularly squat jump analysis, 
    is common in sport science and athlete profiling. This package allows
    you to explore squat jumping with the use of simulation. Besides that,
    the goal of this package is to teach basic biomechanics, FV profiling,
    and exploring assumptions of FV optimization models. This package also
    comes with functions that allow users to analyse and plot their own 
    squat jump data.
